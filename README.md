# inDemniFi Wallet Risk Analysis and Underwriting 

  inDemniFi is building a suite a risk analysis tools to enable us to produce digital asset insurance products for individual users and third-party protocols. Starting the suite of the tools is a wallet risk and underwriting model that can be used as an underwriting tool for us, but more importantly, can be used to educate the wallet user on how their on-chain behavior creates their risk profile and how they can mitigate those risks in order to navigate crypto safely. As the risk profile of the crypto landscape itself continuously fluctuates, so will our risk model which will be dynamic in both parameters selected and thresholds, while continously adding new risk variables over time. This will allow future users to utilize the benefits of Fireblocks already existing security wallet infrastructure along with a live dashboard of their on-chain crypto risk. 

Our codebase in this repository is deployed as a Github page and can be viewed [here](https://indemnifi.github.io/Wallet-Risk) or here: https://indemnifi.github.io/Wallet-Risk
